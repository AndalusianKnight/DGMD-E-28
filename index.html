                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am in the final term of my Junior year at Harvard University. I am a Bachelor of Liberal Arts student at Harvard Extension School with a concentration in Computer Science. At the end of this term, I am applying for the Joint Masters Program for a Master of Liberal Arts in Management. I am originally from Canada, but I last lived there in 2021; I have since lived in over 30 countries as a Digital Nomad working and studying from around the world.

                <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I have about 8 years of experience working with software in a Product Manager role. I have worked with multiple teams of Developers, Designers, and Testers across numerous products. I've worked on mobile applications and the web, ride-sharing apps, encrypted video conferencing, and a bunch of stuff in between. When I exited my previous startup I decided I wanted to finish my degree before going back to work in the industry. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Web Development Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I have taken two courses in Web Development, but I would only really count one of them. I took Web Development, an introduction to HTML and CSS, and we barely touched Javascript. The other course I took was what I like to call the Django debugging and crying course, Web Programming with Python and Javascript. I feel this course didn't help me improve as a web developer and only made me hate Django and never want to use any Python web framework ever again.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Software Development Background</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Computer Science Student, I have taken multiple coding courses before. Courses include Harvard's CS50, AI, Web Development, Web Programming and Data Structures, and Python Programming. These courses were entirely or primarily in Python, except for Web Development, which was only in HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript. Funnily enough, the web programming course was also in Python via the, in my opinion, awful Django framework.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Why DGMD E-28?</h2>
                <p>
                    Because almost all of my classes have been in Python I wanted to take another course on web development so I could level up my skills in that area. I especially am looking forward to dusting off my HTML and CSS skills as well as learning React. I want to be able to create my own websites and web applications.

                <h2>Some More Fun Things I'd Like to Share</h2>
                <p>
                    Since you've made it this far maybe I can share two recommendations with you! First, the Balkans are a super underrated place to travel. Serbia 🇷🇸 and its neighbors are all beautiful, cheap, friendly, and safe places to visit with amazing food! Although they weren’t able to beat Turkey 🇹🇷 on food… Oh! And I am moving to Spain 🇪🇸 this Fall!
